    <p>I'm Kyron, a passionate and experienced full-stack developer specializing in PHP (Laravel), MySQL, and Docker, with proficiency in a wide range of AWS tools including S3, EC2, Route 53, SQS, and SES. With over 6 years of experience in the industry, I've honed my skills to deliver robust and scalable solutions tailored to meet the unique needs of my clients.</p>

    <p>My expertise extends beyond backend development; I'm also well-versed in frontend technologies such as Vue.js and Nuxt.js, enabling me to craft seamless user experiences. I'm a strong advocate for test-driven development (TDD) and unit testing, ensuring that my code is not only functional but also maintainable and reliable.</p>

    <p>Beyond coding, I excel in project and team management, having led numerous successful projects from conception to deployment. My experience in microservices and API management allows me to architect complex systems that are both efficient and scalable. I have a keen eye for software architecture and design, always striving to implement best practices and optimize performance.</p>
